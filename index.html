                    <p>Dear Mom,</p>
                    <p>I find myself at a loss for words to express the depth of my love and gratitude for you...</p>
                    <p>I love you with that Ruth and Naomi kind of love mom, no no, actually, I would say that, with more
                        like the legendary Jonathan to David kind of love. Hey, this runs deep. It is that love in action
                        kind of love, and I still think that is still not enough! I can't even begin to describe this, it
                        is beyond me. It runs so deep, words fail to capture the essence.</p>
                    <p>Because you have been a rock through and through. You have held me down through and through. And
                        through it all you have always been just the perfect mom for me. Thank you for your steadfast love,
                        your support, your friendship, your faith, your courage, your strength, and all your incredible
                        qualities that always keep me inspired. You are the embodiment of the spirit of "Imbokodo", and It
                        is no mystery why the title "mother of nations" resonates with your essence!</p>
                    <p>I celebrate you today, and forevermore! Oh man, it is that big day we have been waiting for,
                        excitement in the air, we can't ignore, got to celebrate and have fun and thank God for all the
                        good he has done and is continuing to do! We are blessed beyond measure!</p>
                    <p>Don't we serve an amazing God, Have we not seen his hand?</p>
                    <p>And I know, He is just beginning His great work, His great, extraordinary and strange work, and I
                        am here for it ðŸ˜„! Let us live it up!</p>
                    <p>Cannot end this message without just touching on this though, thank you for always being there
                        for me mom, seriously, thank you for taking me by hand. I know that you have always done so, but
                        especially this time around. Your prayers, your faith in God, and your strength, they have been a
                        lifeline. Thank you for holding my hand, and leading me to Light, I feel its healing power and its
                        warmth. And I know that Dad is looking down on us with pride. I cherish and treasure you greatly,
                        and strive every day to always make you proud!</p>
                    <p>Love you and Happy Birthday mom!</p>
